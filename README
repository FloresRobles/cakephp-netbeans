WHAT WORKS:
- badge icon
- configuration files
- ignored files
- actions: bake, go to view, go to action

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
- non-interactive way for creating new CakePHP projects (CakePHP's side and then PhpModuleExtender)
- list of possible cake's commands in XML format (CakePHP's side and then FrameworkCommandSupport)
- code completion support (NetBeans internal: ideally move NB's editor API to PHP API)

HOW TO RUN:
- download development build of NetBeans [1] (the newer the better, at least build 2071 needed)
- manually install NBM file

HOW TO DEVELOP:
- read this page [2] for the general overview but notice that current sources need to be used (NB 6.9 won't work), then
- checkout NB sources via Mercurial [3] (preferred, easy updates) or download archive with latest NB sources from NB download site [4]
- Tools > NetBeans Platforms - add new platform "NetBeans IDE Dev" that points to the cloned/downloaded sources
- if not done yet, open this module in NetBeans
- Run
