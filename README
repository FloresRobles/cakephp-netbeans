HOW TO RUN:
- download NBM file or manually create NBM file
- manually install NBM file

HOW TO DEVELOP:
- read this page [2] for the general overview but notice that current sources need to be used (NB 6.9 won't work), then
- checkout NB sources via Mercurial [3] (preferred, easy updates) or download archive with latest NB sources from NB download site [4]
- Tools > NetBeans Platforms - add new platform "NetBeans IDE Dev" that points to the cloned/downloaded sources
- if not done yet, open this module in NetBeans
